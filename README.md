Project was never released for public use. Since my startup has pivoted, we are releasing what we were working on before.
# Kangaroo desktop

## Purpose
We were building a desktop inside the browser to modernize how we use the cloud. We noticed
- Native apps are moving to the web, different apps are building different file management systems
- Files stored on the cloud are just links on the internet
- The need to manage links are increasing
- Cloud storages have high friction

## Implemented Features
- Ability to add links to your cloud-synced desktop
- Ability to store files to your cloud-synced desktop
- Drag and drop desktop items
- Folder structure
- Ability to share folders with others

Together with the chrome extension, you could
- Download files from the internet to Kangaroo Desktop
- Upload files to the internet from Kangaroo Desktop
- Default new tab to Kangaroo Desktop
- Store current tab to Kangaroo Desktop with shortcuts

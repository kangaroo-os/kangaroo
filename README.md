Project was never released for public use. Since my startup has pivoted, we are releasing what we were working on before.
# Kangaroo desktop

## Purpose
We were building a desktop inside to browser to make using the cloud easier. We saw a few things
- Native apps are moving to the web
- Files on the cloud are just links on the internet
- The need to manage links are increasing
- Cloud storages have high friction

So we tried to build a better cloud storage.

## Implemented Features
- Ability to add links to your cloud-synced desktop
- Ability to store files to your cloud-synced desktop
- Ability to share folders with others
